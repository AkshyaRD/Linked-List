# LinkedList

A linked list is a linear data structure, in which the elements are not stored at contiguous memory locations.   
The elements in a linked list are linked using pointers as shown in the below image:

You have to start somewhere, so we give the address of the first node a special name called HEAD.   
Also, the last node in the linked list can be identified because its next portion points to NULL.  
Linked lists can be of multiple types: singly, doubly, and circular linked list. In this article, we will focus on the singly linked list.   

There are three common types of Linked List.  

1) Singly Linked List  
2) Doubly Linked List  
3) Circular Linked List  

#### Singly Linked List  
It is the most common. Each node has data and a pointer to the next node.

#### Doubly Linked List  
We add a pointer to the previous node in a doubly-linked list. Thus, we can go in either direction: forward or backward.

#### Circular Linked List
A circular linked list is a variation of a linked list in which the last element is linked to the first element. This forms a circular loop.

### Linked List Applications  
1)Dynamic memory allocation  
2)Implemented in stack and queue  
3)In undo functionality of softwares  
4)Hash tables, Graphs
